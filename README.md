## About me
Hi, I'm Steven â€“ a programmer, engineer, and perpetual learner.

Though my title is Electrical Engineer, programming is where my heart truly lies. There's a unique satisfaction in the digital world where every problem has a solution waiting to be discovered.

My work often bridges different fields of engineering, combining disciplines to build tools, solve problems, or just create something cool.
- During undergrad, I tutored **Java** and **C++**.
- At an internship, I expanded my skillset with **SQL** and explored **JavaScript**.
- Most of my documented work has been written in **Python**, which has become my go-to language for tackling challenges.

## My Work!
To make life easy, I have cateogrized and organized my work with a dedicated project.
